# North West Powerlifting 2022
 
## The division
### What is NWPL?
NWPL is [North West Powerlifting](https://northwestpowerlifting.com/), a regional division of the [English Powerlifting Association](https://www.englishpowerlifting.co.uk/) and [British Powerlifting](https://www.britishpowerlifting.org/).

Powerlifting is a sport where competitors must perform squat, bench, and deadlift. The results of these lifts are measured in kilograms and may be compared to other lifters of the same weight category gross, or using formulae such as Goodlift to compare lifters of different sexes and weight classes.

## The project
The project will look into regional results for NWPL for 2022 to date (data downloaded 29-SEPT-2022). I want to look at:
- Numbers per competition
- Favoured venues
- Sex / Gender split of competitors
- Performance of competitors, compared to national averages
- Frequency of competitions

## The results
