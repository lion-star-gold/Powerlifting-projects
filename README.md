# Powerlifting-visualisation-and-prediction
Using data from openpowerlifting.org, this project visualises the results of powerlifting competitions and begins to predict outcomes of competitions.

#### What is powerlifting?
Powerlifting is a sport that focuses around three lifts: squat, bench, and deadlift. There are several different organisations that exist but one of the most common is IPF - International Powerlifting Federation - and for clarity, all results discussed in this project are IPF-sanctioned competitions unless stated otherwise.
In a competition, a competitor is weighed and organised into a weight category, then performs each of the three lifts in increasing weight order. The weight is chosen by the competitor, and once all three lifts are completed the total is calculated - the sum of the largest lift in each category.
