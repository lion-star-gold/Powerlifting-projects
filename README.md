# Powerlifting-visualisation-and-prediction
Using data from openpowerlifting.org, this project visualises the results of powerlifting competitions and begins to predict outcomes of competitions.

#### What is powerlifting?
Powerlifting is a sport that focuses around three lifts: <b>squat</b>, <b>bench</b>, and <b>deadlift</b>. There are several different organisations that exist but one of the most common is IPF - International Powerlifting Federation - and for clarity, all results discussed in this project are IPF-sanctioned competitions unless stated otherwise.
In a competition, a competitor is weighed and organised into a weight category, then performs each of the three lifts in increasing weight order. The weight is chosen by the competitor, and once all three lifts are completed the total is calculated - the sum of the largest lift in each category.

#### What is this project?
I really enjoy powerlifting. I love competing, I love seeing others compete, and I love helping others to compete. I decided to visualise past results as a way to see how the sport has grown, and how performance in the sport has changed over time - and how it may change in the future. Its inspiring to watch records be broken year-on-year, and see performances change over time.

The data for this project was pulled from openpowerlifting.org on 05-Jan-2022.

##### Competition attendance
I've been in the powerlifting community for a few years now and have first-hand seen the sport increase in popularity. Let's make a visualisation of this!

Using data from all classic powerlifting competions:

We see a huge increase in competitors from 2014 - 2015, followed by further steadier increases up until 2020 where competitions were heavily impacted by COVID-related disruption. Due to lockdowns both total and partial 2020 - 2021 the number of competitors was greatly reduced.

While this graph of the number of competitions includes 2008 - slightly precluding the official founding of the British Powerlifting federation - it shows a similar trend as the number of competitors as above.

Here we can see a gradual increase in the amount of women competitors in classic powerlifting, curtailed slightly in 2021.
